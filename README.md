# Team Generator App

![Team Generator](./images/teamhtml.png)

## Description

This application takes in user input on the command line to generate an html page of their teams key information.

## Usage

The user accesses this application through the command line. They use node to run the app.js file which will prompt them with a list of team member types to add to their roster. After selecting a member type, they will be prompted with a series of questions related to that position.

Once they are finished assembling their team, they select that they do not have any more team members and their HTML file will be generated in the output folder ready to view in your browser.

## Creating This Page

This application was created in node.js with javascript. The main challenges I faced with this project was overcoming testing. Unit testing feels like a backwards way of programming to me.  It draws a very narrow box to operate inside of and doesn't let you stray from that. This concept does make more sense to me after working on this project.  It gave me a clear direction that I needed to go in to solve the problems being presented. Working from the unit tests made the development clear and methodical. My next challenge was setting up the Inquirer prompts. This was done through trial and error to get to what I feel like is some of the cleanest code that I have written so far.
